# GEMPOT

_Etymology_: **G**olang T**empo** (time, in Portuguese) **T**racker.

Golang-based CLI to help users track time spent in projects and/or with clients.

This CLI application makes sense if you like to live in the terminal-land and you hate maintaining spreadsheets.
After installing the tool, your home dir will contain a new `.gempo-time.csv` file, which contains all entries in this 
format.
This CLI provides methods for:

- Start tracking time;
- Stop tracking time;
- Get total hours in **date filters**, partially supporting bits of natural language - like `last month` or `last 3 weeks` 
while supporting things like project IDs;


# INSTALLING

If you have `golang` installed in your system, you can install the tool directly in your `GOPATH` with `go install github.com/gsilvapt/gempo@latest`.

If you do not have `golang`, you can download a binary for your system at [releases].
